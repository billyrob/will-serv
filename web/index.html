    Hello this is my blog/website. <br>
    I'm a backend services developer so please forgive the lack of any flair in the design of this site. It should hopefully load quickly without a huge JS framework :)<br>
    I've been primarily doing Python and dev ops since graduating college in 2013. Recently I have started picking up Rust in my free time as a repreive from the world of dynamic languages.
